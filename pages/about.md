# About

Hi! I'm Hsaka, an indie game developer from Trinidad. GamePyong was created back in 2009 with the goal of making games that bring joy to the lives of people everywhere. While we mostly focus on web games due to the ease with which they can be shared, we also dabble in mobile and desktop game development using games engines such as Phaser, Godot, Unity and Unreal Engine. This blog was started in order to share the game development journey and hopefully help others along the way.
